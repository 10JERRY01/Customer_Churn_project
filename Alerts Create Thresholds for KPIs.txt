Alerts: Create Thresholds for KPIs
Integrate alerts for KPIs like Churn Rate > 20% or Low Usage Frequency.

In Tableau:
Churn Rate Alert:

Create a calculated field:
tableau
Copy code
IF SUM(IF [Churn] = 'Yes' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) / COUNT([CustomerID]) > 0.2 THEN "Alert: High Churn"
ELSE "Churn Rate Normal"
END
Add this field to the dashboard.
Low Usage Alert:

Define a threshold:
tableau
Copy code
IF AVG([Usage Frequency]) < 10 THEN "Alert: Low Engagement"
ELSE "Usage Normal"
END
Trigger Notification:

Use a red indicator (e.g., color card) for KPIs breaching thresholds.
In Power BI:
KPI Card with Alerts:

Add a DAX measure:
dax
Copy code
ChurnAlert = IF(CALCULATE(SUM(CustomerData[Churn]) / COUNT(CustomerData[CustomerID])) > 0.2, "High Churn Alert", "Normal")
Use conditional formatting to color-code the card.
Email Notifications (Power BI Pro):

Set up a data-driven alert for Churn Rate > 20%.
Configure the Power BI Service to send email notifications.
