# Customer_Churn_project
This project involves building an end-to-end solution to monitor operational KPIs using a customer churn dataset. The solution includes automated data processing, predictive insights, and an interactive dashboard for real-time decision-making.
1. Project Overview
This project involves building an end-to-end solution to monitor operational KPIs using a customer churn dataset. The solution includes automated data processing, predictive insights, and an interactive dashboard for real-time decision-making.

2. Objectives
Monitor KPIs: Track key metrics like churn rate, customer engagement, and revenue trends.
Predictive Insights: Identify high-risk customers using a churn prediction model.
Alerts: Notify stakeholders about critical thresholds like high churn rates.
Interactive Dashboard: Provide dynamic visualizations for detailed analysis.
3. Key Features
KPI Monitoring: Real-time metrics for churn rate, average customer spend, and engagement.
Predictive Insights: Logistic regression model to forecast churn probabilities.
Threshold-Based Alerts: Automated notifications for KPI breaches.
Interactive Dashboard: Filters for Gender, Subscription Type, Age, and more.
4. Implementation
4.1 ETL Pipeline
Data Sources: Simulated customer churn dataset.
Process:
Extract data from the source (CSV or SQLite database).
Clean and preprocess data using Python (Pandas and NumPy).
Load cleaned data into a database or export to CSV.
4.2 Predictive Insights
Model: Logistic Regression (Scikit-learn).
Input Features:
Age, Gender, Tenure, Usage Frequency, Support Calls, Payment Delay, Subscription Type, Contract Length, Total Spend.
Output: Predicted churn (Yes/No) and churn probability.
Use Case: Segment customers into high, medium, and low risk categories.
4.3 Dashboard Design
Platform: Tableau or Power BI.
Visuals:
KPI Cards: Churn rate, average spend, and usage trends.
Bar Chart: Churn by subscription type.
Line Chart: Usage trends over tenure.
Heatmap: Churn rates segmented by gender and age groups.
Filters:
Dynamic filters for Gender, Subscription Type, and Age.
4.4 Alerts & Notifications
Platform: Power BI Service.
Configuration:
Set alert thresholds (e.g., Churn Rate > 20%).
Configure email notifications for stakeholders.
Advanced Workflow: Use Power Automate for SMS or Teams notifications.
5. Dataset
Columns:

CustomerID: Unique identifier for customers.
Age: Customer's age.
Gender: Customer's gender (Male/Female).
Tenure: Length of time the customer has been with the company (in months).
Usage Frequency: Average frequency of usage (e.g., logins or activity).
Support Calls: Number of support calls made.
Payment Delay: Average delay in payments (in days).
Subscription Type: Subscription tier (e.g., Basic, Premium).
Contract Length: Length of the contract (e.g., 12 months, 24 months).
Total Spend: Total amount spent by the customer.
Last Interaction: Time since the last customer interaction.
Churn: Whether the customer has churned (Yes/No).
6. Alerts
High Churn Rate Alert:
Trigger: Churn Rate > 20%.
Notification: Email to decision-makers.
Low Usage Alert:
Trigger: Usage Frequency < 10.
Notification: Highlight on the dashboard.
7. Deliverables
Cleaned Dataset:
File: cleaned_customer_data.csv.
Format: CSV.
Dashboard:
Platforms: Tableau/Power BI.
Shared via Tableau Public or Power BI Service.
Model Output:
File: customer_data_with_predictions.csv.
Columns: Churn predictions and probabilities.
Alerts:
Email notifications and Power Automate workflows.
8. Instructions for Use
Data Processing:
Run the Python script to preprocess and clean data.
Save the cleaned dataset as cleaned_customer_data.csv.
Model Training:
Execute the logistic regression script to generate predictions.
Save the output as customer_data_with_predictions.csv.
Dashboard Setup:
Import the dataset into Tableau/Power BI.
Create visualizations as outlined in the design section.
Alert Configuration:
Set thresholds for alerts in Power BI Service.
Test notifications by modifying the dataset and refreshing the dashboard.
9. Impact
Proactive identification of churn risks.
Improved decision-making through real-time monitoring.
Enhanced stakeholder communication with automated alerts.
Scalable solution for operational KPI tracking.
10. Next Steps
Enhancements:
Integrate additional data sources (e.g., CRM, web analytics).
Use advanced ML models (e.g., Random Forest, XGBoost) for predictions.
Deployment:
Deploy the dashboard on a cloud platform for broader access.
Automate the ETL pipeline with tools like Apache Airflow.
