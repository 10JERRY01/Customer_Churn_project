Designing the Dashboard in Tableau/Power BI
Here’s how you can use the cleaned dataset to design an interactive dashboard that displays the KPIs for monitoring customer engagement, churn, and other metrics.

Step 1: Preparing Data for Import
Ensure Dataset Format:

Save the cleaned data to a CSV or directly connect Tableau/Power BI to the SQLite database.
File name: cleaned_customer_data.csv
Important Columns for Dashboard:

CustomerID
Age
Gender
Tenure
Usage Frequency
Support Calls
Payment Delay
Subscription Type
Contract Length
Total Spend
Churn
Step 2: Import Data
In Tableau:
Open Tableau and click Connect to Data.
Choose Text File (for CSV) or SQLite (for the database).
Load the cleaned_customer_data.csv file or connect to the database.
In Power BI:
Open Power BI and click Get Data → Choose Text/CSV or Database.
Load the cleaned_customer_data.csv file or connect to the SQLite database.
Step 3: Create Dashboard Components
1. KPI Cards
Metric: Churn Rate

Formula in Tableau:
tableau
Copy code
SUM(IF [Churn] = 'Yes' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) / COUNT([CustomerID])
Visual: KPI Card displaying churn rate percentage.
Metric: Average Spend

Formula:
tableau
Copy code
AVG([Total Spend])
Visual: KPI Card showing average spend per customer.
2. Bar Chart: Churn by Subscription Type
Dimension: Subscription Type
Measure: Percentage of churn (Churn = Yes).
Tableau:
Drag Subscription Type to Columns.
Drag Churn to Rows → Filter Yes.
Use the Quick Table Calculation → Percent of Total.
Power BI:
Use a clustered bar chart and filter for Churn = Yes.
Visual: Stacked bar chart showing churn percentage for each subscription type.
3. Time-Series Chart: Usage Trends
Dimension: Tenure (Months).
Measure: Average Usage Frequency.
Visual: Line chart showing trends in usage frequency over tenure.
4. Heatmap: Churn by Gender and Age
Rows: Gender
Columns: Age groups (create age bins like 18–25, 26–35, etc.).
Measure: Churn percentage.
Tableau:
Use Churn as a filter and calculate churn rate for each bin.
Use the Density chart option.
Power BI:
Use a matrix or heatmap visual with color gradients for churn percentage.
5. Filters
Add dynamic filters for:
Age
Gender
Subscription Type
Contract Length
Step 4: Adding Interactivity
Tableau:
Add filter actions to allow clicking on a subscription type or segment to update all charts.
Use parameter controls for setting thresholds (e.g., highlight customers with low usage frequency).
Power BI:
Use slicers for Gender, Subscription Type, and Age.
Create drill-through pages to see detailed metrics per customer.
Step 5: Dashboard Layout
Suggested Layout:
Top Row (KPI Cards):

Churn Rate | Average Spend | Revenue Loss
Middle Row (Visuals):

Left: Bar Chart (Churn by Subscription Type)
Right: Time-Series (Usage Trends)
Bottom Row (Advanced Analysis):

Left: Heatmap (Churn by Gender & Age)
Right: Customer Segment Breakdown Table
Step 6: Exporting & Sharing
Tableau:
Publish to Tableau Public or your Tableau Server.
Share the link or embed the dashboard in a website.
Power BI:
Publish to Power BI Service.
Share the dashboard with stakeholders using a direct link.
Additional Enhancements
Predictive Insights: Incorporate the churn prediction model built earlier.
Alerts: Create thresholds for KPIs (e.g., Churn Rate > 20%) to trigger notifications.
Documentation: Write a README or create a walkthrough video for the dashboard.
